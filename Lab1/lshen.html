<p style="color:green">   Beijing is a city in China with many attractions. The Great Wall of China, which passes through Beijing, was built very early for China to defend against their military opponents. Today it has became an artifact. The Grand Canal was built a little later to help the Chinese transport many materials using boats throughout the country. It has become a place to visit. The forbidden city is built by a late family of rulers to enjoy themselves and their other officials. After the rulers were overthrown, it has gradually opened to become a popular attraction today. </p>
